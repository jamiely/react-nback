            A sequence of things will play out.
            Remember what happened 2 rounds ago!
            If the same thing that is happening
            now happened 2 rounds ago, click the
            corresponding button. For example, if
            the symbol is in the same location as
            2 rounds ago, click the Location button.
            If the audio is the same as 2 rounds ago,
            click the Audio button. If the symbol
            matches the symbol 2 rounds ago, click
            the symbol button.
